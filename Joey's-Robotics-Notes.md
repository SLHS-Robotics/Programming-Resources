# Preamble

Hi y'all it's me, Joey from the class of 2024, let me introduce what this doc is before you jump right into it.

This doc is my personal notes that I assembled throughout the 2023-2024 season as the programming lead. This doc is mostly organized chronologically, but should also be organized in a somewhat sane way. This doc starts at the beginning of the season, created in mid October of 2023. Most of these notes were for my personal learning and grappling with what the task of programing entailed and what needed to go into it. In the offseason I also started helping out with the middle school's programming team, and I started taking notes on what we did and goals for every week.

> As I am reformatting this into markdown, I'll leave some comments in blockquotes (like this) to hopefully clear some stuff up.

# Robotics stuff

> This is real early days here
> I had never been a part of a robotics team before this, so I had a lot to learn
> Please excuse me if some of this here at the begining is a little naive

# New meeting plans

adding mondays

fridays extended to 6-6:30

Move Fri-15 to Thurs-14

**Build team**

Arm done by break

Design of basket by break - Friday 15th

- 3D print individually during break

Funnel in week after break

**Break**

School is open 18th - 22nd

## **Lessons learned from DCI**


> After our competition at the DC International School, we gathered as a club and discussed how we did and what lessons we learned
> This could probably be good to look back over before another competition

### Things to improve

Need a proper go box

Needed practice before

Spend much more time working on portfolio

Plane is good

Better delegation

We need to write out a script for judging

~~Replace poor quality usb cables~~

Chains

- Chains catching on stuff

- Remove slack from chains

~~Fix directions for strafing~~

Add hanging mechanism to basket

Do more scouting at comps

Place pixel on board and park during auto

We want to hang

Make back up airplanes

Get legal team props?

Create tri-fold

Do more leadership meetings

- and minutes

~~Teach people how to run the robot~~

Move the license plate that is behind the chain

M‚Äåake pad for control stuff

Fix phones box

### Things we did well

Good points per round

Good attitude when teammates bots had issues

Gracious professionalism

Handling stuff on the fly

Call to remove linear slide

Fixing the binder at the beginning

Write up a checklist to start up the robot

**New basket system**

Still using lifting mechanism

lifting up a bar with the pixel holder on it

Spin the bar around (with a servo) to dispense pixel

---

# Plans for autonomous

If on  far side, move through the gate in the middle to park in backstage

if starting at the back of the field, park in backstage

### **Leadership meeting notes**

**Meeting dates**

long meeting Tuesday

Thursday is also long

Saturday

- Could be as early as 8 ish

- Maybe meet elsewhere to work longer

How are we testing with the backdrop

**Judging for programming**

How build communicated their needs with us

- Needs for safety backups

8 Revolutions all to get all the way up

- the motor is 537.6 pulses per minute 

Continuous control of lift system

- Still needs software endstops

Add d pad left to only close the lift to hanging point

Claw becomes a button that flips and flops it

**Stuff from the middle school**

Allen keys

Phillips screwdriver

Tape measure

## Off season ideas

Build sizing tool

3d Scan bot and 3d print mini bot

3d scan and print Napoleon 

Create ‚ÄúGuide‚Äù for next season

- Engineering notebook but just for us

Work on multiple solutions at once

- Design in parallel

- Almost like building stuff for the government/military

  - They want a fighter, everyone makes one, they pick their favorite

- Sorta like competitive

Season starts beginning of August

# Training team

> When we started the offseason, we split up into goofy teams and I was in charge of the training team
> This section consists of goals/plans for what we were going to do during offseason, both as the whole club and as the training team
> Training team was also going to be the brains behind helping with the middle school

Furthering knowledge/skills proficiency with FTC tools (software and hardware)

(hopefully) self led

- Maybe 3 mini teams (one for each pair of phones)

People who want to do CAD/Programming next season

- Maybe we could put CAD with programming under software

  - Encourage a blending between the two groups

Train people to give lessons

- Get them to learn something, they present/teach next meeting

Teaching stuff to middleschoolers, new people who come in with readvertizing, and people already here

> Okay so yeah i'm not going to mess with the indentation for the code here, this is all yap anyways
> If someone reading this thinks this seems prommising or useful, please pursue this path
> When I was writing this, I thought it had the possibility of being more efficient in some way
> Idea was that reading the movement from the controller could be more costly than storing it all in binary, and parsing that after the fact would save time, maybe?

[Possibly teach them some bitwise stuff](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/op3.html)

```java
01 == //`a` button
10 == //`b` button

if movement > 0:
	direction = 1
	if (n == 2) {direction = -1}
	pos += stepSize * direction
```

What is a bool * double???

Will false = 0 and true = double?

If true, then could do a oneliner. Something like:

```java
movement = (1 * a) + (2 * b) + (4 * x) + (8 * y)

// Might need to convert the bools to numbers by doing something like
a ? 1 : 0
```

Could even add other movement to that

Then the if from before becomes

```java
// let movement = 0b111001

if ((movement & 0b11) > 0){ // equivalent to (((movement >> 0) & 0b11) > 0)
	// movement == 01
} else if (((movement >> 2) & 0b11) > 0) {
	// movement == 10
} else if (((movement >> 4) & 0b11) > 0) {
	// movement == 11
}
```

Full process would look like this

```java
// Init vars
stepSize = something;

// In main loop
movement = (1 * a) + (2 * b) + (4 * x) + (8 * y)

if (((movement >> 0) & 0b11) > 0 ) {
	servo1Position += stepSize * (1 * -((movement >> 1) & 0b1))
}
if (((movement >> 2) & 0b11) > 0 ) {
	servo2Position += stepSize * (1 * -((movement >> 3) & 0b1))
}

//
```

Next time we will have to test

## SL


> Okay so this next section was just what I wrote to submit the time working with the middle school team for service learning for IBCP


My high school‚Äôs rookie robotics team uses the most advanced set of tools for programming our robots, and in order to bring in new, knowledgeable team members for next year‚Äôs competition season, I volunteered to help teach and tutor students in the Langston Hughes Middle School (LHMS) robotics teams in order to teach them programming and pass on knowledge on the tools that the high school team uses. I joined them at their robotics meetings and worked with them in small groups of three to five students. This year, only three members of the LHMS had proficient knowledge pertaining to programming. The rest of the members of the club, approximately 15 students, had very little to no programming knowledge or experience. I worked to find tools which they could easily access from their school laptops to teach them basic programming knowledge.

Finding appropriate tools was difficult because of various restrictions and criteria I followed when selecting a system. Firstly, the tool needed to be accessible in school and run on their laptops. This immediately limited the selection to web applications, as installing programs to the school computers may be difficult and would be cumbersome for a teaching scenario. As I was limited to web applications, I also needed to make sure that the site I chose would be accessible while connected to the school‚Äôs WiFi network. This ruled out MIT‚Äôs Scratch, because it is blocked on the school‚Äôs network. To keep the process simple, I wanted to use a platform that did not require the students to make an account, as that would be cumbersome. I chose to use OpenProcessing to teach new students because it fit my criteria. OpenProcessing is also designed for creating visuals which could be beneficial as it would be very easy for them to see how their changes effect program execution.

I also worked with them using the advanced programming tools. Our team uses Android Studio to program our robot. I was able to get them access to Android Studio so that they can learn how it works. I was able to teach them how the code is organized in an Android Studio project and the structure for the code that is uploaded to the robot. I was able to teach them all of basic elements that are involved in creating an OpMode for the robot using our tools.
